Notes: 

The scripts main.py and inference.py were written assuming that the current working directory during their execution would be "<path>/assignment-4". This assumption was made in order to locate the pretrained models like w2v.model in main.py and tokenizer.pkl, the nn models in inference.py.

The Amazon corpus was preprocessed again and resplit into 80/10/10 data sets with labels for assignment 4 due to format issues. The new data sets used in main.py are in "/assignment-4/data"
