Three Google colab notebooks were used for this project.

1) Binary BERT training (unrelated vs. related)
2) Ternary BERT training (agree, disagree, discuss)
3) Two purposes in notebook 3:
    a) Experiment 2: loss balancing on baseline BERT model
    b) Ensemble BERT model code (combining predictions from both models 1 and 2).
